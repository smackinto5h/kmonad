# kmonad

ever just wish you had something established for you already that just worked?
well here i will share my layouts for my personal homerow mods and other keyboard
reconfigurations for kmonad. i really enjoy using kmonad for my homerow mods since
a lot of other solutions that work on linux or macos just dont work on windows but
this does. so heres my .kbd files to make it easier. hope it helps someone lost.
i wish i would have found this when i was looking. lol so thats why i created it. 

thanks for looking.
